%first question: is this a valid matrix? if not correct it
aMatrx = [1 3 2 3; 6 7 8 9]% this is a valid matrix

%second question: is this a valid matrix? if not correct it
aMatrx = [1 3 2 3; 5 3 6; 7 8 9]% this is an invalid matrix
correction_matrx = [1 3 3; 5 3 6; 7 8 9]

%third question: is this a valid matrix? if not correct it
aMatrx = [1 3 ; 5 3 ;  8 9]% this is a valid matrix

%fourth question: is this a valid matrix? if not correct it
aMatrx = [1 3 2; 5 6; 7 8 9]% this is an invalid matrix
correction_matrx = [1 3 3; 5 3 6; 7 8 9]
